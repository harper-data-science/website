## Workflow for R scripts

- An R script is a plain text file 

- Ends in “dot R” (.R) by default

- Interface between your commands and R software

- Documents your analysis

- Interface between your commands and R software

- Organized and logical, has meaning for other people

## R script organisation

```
# 01 First line of a CODE CHUNK ####
```

- Code chunks start with a hash sign `#`

- Title descriptive of contents

- End with (at least) four hash signs `####`

- Numbered titles optional

- Visual + navigation function

## R script comments

```
# Vector of numbers << a comment
my_variable <- c(2,5,3,6,3,4,7)

# Calculate the mean << another comment
mean(my_variable)

```
Comments explain your code

## R script "submitting" commands

- Run whole line of code your cursor rests on Ctrl+Enter (`Cmd+Return` in Macs)

- Run code you have selected `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Return` in Macs)

- Use the “Run” menu above the Script window

- Use the Code > Run dropdown menu
