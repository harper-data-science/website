    "section": "3 Basic quarto editing",
    "text": "3 Basic quarto editing\nWe are going to set up the most basic quarto website that has two Sections, each with one webpage.\n\n3.1 _quarto.yaml\nYAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markdown Language”\nMarkdown is a language designed to easily format plain text into modern HTML, which can get complicated\nHTML is HyperText Markup Language, which formats web content documents\nYour _quarto.yaml file allows you to control formatting on your website in a very terse way. There are many options, but they are easy to use and the documentation is very good (see Resources below).\nBasically we are going to:\n\nmake a website type document\nset the output directory for html\nmake sidebar navigation\nset the theme for our website\nenable the “visual” editor in RStudio (slightly buggy but useful)\n\n\n\n3.2 Default YAML\nOpen your _quarto.yaml file in the RStudio editor.\n    project:                << project type\n      type: website\n\n    website:                << website options\n      title: \"website\"      << title\n      navbar:               << navbar options\n        left:\n          - href: index.qmd\n            text: Home\n          - about.qmd\n\n    format:                 << themes and aesthetics\n      html:\n        theme: cosmo\n        css: styles.css\n        toc: true\nWe can quickly see visually how this default YAML file “renders” your website. RStudio will automatically generate .html pages based on code in your .qmd files (our default website has only one .qmd, but a website will typically have more). Then RStudio will launch a “local server” to “host” your rendered website on your local browser to preview it. Let’s do that now:\n\nOpen the index.qmd file in RStudio\nNotice the Quarto Render button\nClick Render!\n\n\n\nYour new website should look like this:\n\n\n\n3.3 Custom YAML\nCustomizing your .yaml file is The Way () to customize your website.\nCopy and past the new yaml below into your _quarto.yaml file. This will:\n\nDirect html outputs to a docs subfolder\nCustomize the website title (use your own)\nCreate a “docked” navigation system\nChange the html theme\nAdd a user-interactive theme button\n\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"R Stats Bootcamp\"\n  sidebar:\n#    logo: \n    style: \"docked\"\n    search: true\n    contents: \n      - section: \"Information\"\n        contents:\n          - index.qmd\nformat:\n  html:\n    highlight-style: a11y\n    theme:\n      light: flatly\n      dark: darkly\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\neditor: visual\nNow save it and hit render!\n A. The locally hosted address\nB. The site title\nC. The theme button (dark chosen here)\nD. The Section and page links\n\n\n3.4 .nojekyll\nA strength of Quarto is that is does all of the clever stuff for nice webpages and we can use this on Github. However, Github does some of this by default (far less cleverly). We want to turn this off. There is an easy way to do this by creating an empty placeholder document called .nojekyll in your repo root directory. The presence of this file tells github not to render the markdown by it’s own system (their system being called “Jekyll”).\nNote in the RStudio Terminal (which emulates Linux for [sic] Windoze users)\n\nIn your Terminal window:"
