Pplease give this link for those who may want to install docker desktop to try stuff out:

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

For those who are super keen and manage to download and install it they can open a cmd window and run the following cryptic command to get a sneak preview:

docker run -ti -v c:\harug:/home/rstudio/shared -e PASSWORD=harper -p 8787:8787 -p 5900:5901 onthesofa/harug-workspace
Once they do that they can go to 'localhost:8787' in their browser or just 'localhost' in a vnc viewer.

Thanks,

Matt

P.S. If something else is planned I'm happy to do it another time.
