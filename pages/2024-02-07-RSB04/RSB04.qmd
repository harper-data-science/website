R Functions

`Imagine your computer's memory is like space and you are alone floating in it.  Anything you you can see floating with you is a Data Object in R-Space.`

## Objectives

- Basic data types in R

- Data with factors

- `class()` and converting variables

- Vector and Matrix fun

- Practice exercises


## Basic data types in R

- Concept of "Data Objects"

- Data you can use is in the Global Environment 

- Data Type refers to the kind of data (important for computers)

- Data Type is determined automatically in R (by the passive-aggressive Butler)

- You often will need and want to tweak data type

## Basic data types in R

```
# numeric vector
variable_1 <- c(4,5,7,6,5,4,5,6,7,10,3,4,5,6) 

# logical vector
variable_2 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 

```
## Basic data types in R

There are some rules for naming data objects

- Can contain letters, numbers, some symbolic characters

- Begin with a letter, Does not contain spaces

- Some things are forbidden, `@`, `%`, `#`, etc.

- Should be human-readable, consistent, and not too long

## Basic data types in R


```
x1 <- 5  

x2 <- "It was a dark and stormy night" 

# hard to read
my_variable_9283467 <- 1 

```


## Data with factors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Let's you want to analyse categorical data.

Sometimes this is called a "factor".

## Data with factors

Two types of factors

- Non-ordered factors : the levels are the names of the categories
**cows** = Martha, Ruth, Edith

- Ordered factors: have a specific order
**dose** = Control < Half < Full

## class() and converting variables

```

# non-ordered factor
variety <- c("short", "short", "short",
             "early", "early", "early",
             "hybrid", "hybrid", "hybrid")
         

```

## Vector and Matrix fun

Ways of organizing data

<br>

- Vector - One dimension from 1 to i, `my_vec[i]`

- Matrix - Two dimensions rows, columns, `my_mat[i, j]`

- Array - Three (or more) dimensions, `my_array[i, j, k]`

## Vector and Matrix fun

```
# Vectors

myvec1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5) 
myvec1
class(myvec1) 

myvec2 <- as.character(myvec1) 

```

## Vector and Matrix fun

```
vec1 <- 1:16 
vec1 

mat1 <- matrix(data = vec1, 
               ncol = 4, 
               byrow = FALSE) 
```
