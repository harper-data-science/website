Exploring data

`We call sizing up the data “weighing the pig”.`

<br>
:::
:::

## Objectives

-Question formulation 

-Summarize: Weighing the Pig

-Variables and graphing

-“Analysis” versus “EDA”

-Statistical Analysis Plan: the concept


## Question formulation and hypothesis testing

-"population of interest"

-samples and sampling

-test statistics

-null hypothesis

-Let's talk about the P-value

## Question formulation and hypothesis testing

Benefits of NHST

-Familiar and acceptable to researchers

-Typically robust to assumptions

-Strong framework for evidence

-The basic idea is simple

## Question formulation and hypothesis testing

Criticism of HNST

-Often interpreted under error

-Validation of analysis often neglected

-Education often deficient

-Practitioners ignorant of subtleties

## Summarize: Weighing the Pig

Chick weight dataset

`The hypothesis voices “how you think the world works” or what you predict to be true”`

**coding**

## Variables and graphing

## Variables and graphing

-Must convey relevant information

-Consistent in aesthetics

-Self-contained

-Reflect hypothesis (unless descriptive)

-Appropriate to data

## Variables and graphing


Concept of "layering" in building graphs

**coding**

## “Analysis” versus “EDA”

EDA:

-Informal, haphazard

-Gain data understanding

-Test assumptions

-Usually not for "others"

-Usually occurs before analysis

## “Analysis” versus “EDA”

Analysis:

-Designed to fit hypothesis

-For presentation to others

-Creation of EVIDENCE to support CLAIMS

-Reproducible

## Statistical Analysis Plan: the concept

Prior to data collection

-formally state hypothesis

-State specific statistical model(s)

-Specify data and data collection

-State and justify sample size
