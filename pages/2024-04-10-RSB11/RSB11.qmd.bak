## Objectives

-   The question of the t-test

-   Data and assumptions

-   Graphing

-   Test and alternatives

-   Practice exercises


## The question of the t-test

<br>

-   Compare 2 means, independent samples

-   Compare 1 mean to a known pop'n mean

-   Compare 2 means, paired (non-independent) samples

-   Null hypothesis significance testing

## Two means, independent samples

<br>

- maybe: a control group and a treatment group

- maybe: 2 different treatments

- meaning of independence

- sampling considerations

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>


## One mean to a known pop'n mean

<br>

- maybe: a treatment group and past data

- maybe: a new circumstance and a known gold standard

- meaning of independence

- sampling considerations

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>


## Paired samples

<br>

- maybe: before and after groups

- maybe: baseline to a treatment group

- meaning of independence

- sampling considerations

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>

## Data and assumptions

<br>

- Gaussian distribution of observations WITHIN each sample

- Heteroscedasticity (our old friend) - i.e., the variance is equal in each sample

- Independence of observations

- Philosphy of testing these assumptions

## Data and assumptions

<br>

**NB 1** the assumption of Gaussian does not apply to to ALL OBSERVATIONS TOGETHER but TO EACH SAMPLE SEPARATELY (sometimes confusing for beginners)

<br>

**NB 2** testing whether each sample is Gaussian is analogous to testing whether the residuals are Gaussian for regression.

## Assumptions: dumb way

## Assumptions: smart way

## The Shapiro test

<br>

Formal test of whether your data are different to Gaussian

<br>

`shapiro.test()`

## Example: 2 sample t-test

<br>

- independent samples

>We detected a significant difference between mean height for tree grown at high or low density (2-sample t-test: t = -8.63, df = 11.9, P < 0.0001).

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>

## Example: 1 sample t-test

<br>

- known population mean

>We found no evidence the mean length of earwigs in our sample was different to the historical mean (1-sample t-test: t = 1.78, df = 19, P-value = 0.09).

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>

## Example: paired t-test

<br>

- pairs of non-independent samples, like repeated measures

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>

## Example: non-parametric

<br>

- when the assumptions don't hold

- "Mann-Whitney test" same as "Wilcoxon test"

`wilcox.test()`

>We found evidence of a difference in the number of eggs ... (Mann-Whitney U-test: W = 63.5, n = [15, 15], P = 0.037) )

<br><center> ~Let's code!~ </center>
