## Spatial Data in R

<br>

## Outline

<br>

-   Ch 01:
    -   Overview
    -   The datasets

## Spatial data advancements

<br>

-   Increase in sensors, increase in available data

-   Statistical methods and software

-   So-called `spatial data`

-   subtleties, but basically geolocated, x and y coordinates

-   CRS (Coordinate Reference System\[s\])

## Sensors and satellites

## Special problems

<br>

Statistical properties of spatial data

1)  Spatial data has a lot of data points, so `power` is large even for `tiny effect sizes`, thus the Null is always rejected (even if practically meaningless)

2)  Spatial data points near each other are almost never `independent`, violating the common assumption that they are (a/k/a `spatial autocorrelation`)

## Special problems

<br>

Ecological properties of spatial data

-   Low 'ecological resolution'

-   High 'data resolution'

-   Complex relationships

(next slide shows **Soil moisture**, **Veg reflectance**, **Yield**...)

## Cressie's classification

<br>

1)  **Geo-statistical data** x-y point data with a continuous measure (like soil moisture). Extrapolation between measured points is a goal.

2)  **Areal data** points or polygons representing a uniform unit of measure (like the crop planted within a field boundary)

3)  **Point pattern data** what is the spatial pattern (like whether pest outbreaks are random or spatially explained by some feature)


## Geostatistical versus Areal

## Components of spatial data

<br>

1)  Spatial component (x-y)

2)  Attribute component (something measured or classified)

3)  Scale and sample size (for measuring earthworms, is 1m or 1000m better to sample?)

4)  **Vector data** versus **Raster data**


## Dataset 1

## Dataset 1

What spatial featured are associated with presence in this species? (Data has shapes and attributes)

## Dataset 2

Oak woodland habitat characteristics

<center>

</center>


## Dataset 2 

Why does young oak "recruitment" vary?

Data are rows and columns with x-y coords

Infer where habitat is suitable for oak population growth.

## Dataset 3 

Rice farming, flooding and crop rotation

<center>

![](img/ch01-rice.png){width=70%}

</center>

## Dataset 3 

Spatial orientation of fields

Yield, different farmers

What factors affect yield (e.g. why do some farmers do better than others?)


## Dataset 4

Spatial comparison of yield in 2 fields with identical management and crop history

Precision agriculture

What factors affect within-field variation in yield?
