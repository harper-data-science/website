A `reposity` ("repo") is a backup version of your directory, often in the cloud

<br>

If you make changes to your local version, you will need to add them to your `repo`

## There is some jargon

<br>

`pull` - gets the latest version from you repo

<br>

`commit` - tells git you are sure you want to add local changes to your repo

<br>

`push` - sends the changes in your commit to your repo

<br>

`clone` - copy a repo (usually someone else's)
