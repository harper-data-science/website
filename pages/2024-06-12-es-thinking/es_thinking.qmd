## Introduction to Effect Size Thinking
>Effect size is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of a phenomenon. 

>It provides more information than p-values, which only tell us whether an effect exists but not how large it is.

---

## Why Effect Sizes Matter
- **Practical Significance**: Beyond statistical significance, effect sizes help us understand the real-world impact of findings.
- **Comparison Across Studies**: Effect sizes allow for comparison of results across different studies and disciplines.

---

## Types of Effect Sizes
There are several common measures of effect size:

- **Cohen's d**: Used for comparing the means of two groups.

- **Pearson's r**: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

- **Odds Ratio**: Used in logistic regression to describe the odds of an event occurring.

---

## Cohen's d
Cohen's d is used to express the difference between two means in terms of standard deviation units.

- **Formula**: $$ d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{pooled}} $$

- **Interpretation**: 0.2 = small effect, 0.5 = medium effect, 0.8 = large effect

---

## Pearson's r
Pearson's r measures the linear relationship between two variables.

- **Range**: -1 to +1

- **Interpretation**: 0.1 = small effect, 0.3 = medium effect, 0.5 = large effect

## Odds Ratio
The odds ratio is used to determine the odds of an event occurring in one group compared to another.

- **Formula**: $$ OR = \frac{(a/b)}{(c/d)} $$
  - \( a \) = number of events in Group 1
  - \( b \) = number of non-events in Group 1
  - \( c \) = number of events in Group 2
  - \( d \) = number of non-events in Group 2

---

## Odds Ratio
The odds ratio is used to determine the odds of an event occurring in one group compared to another.

- **Formula**: $$ OR = \frac{(a/b)}{(c/d)} $$

- **Interpretation**: **OR = 1** means no difference; **OR > 1** means the event is more likely in the first group; **OR < 1** means the event is less likely in the first group

---

## Effect Size Interpretation
Effect sizes must be interpreted in context:

- **Domain Knowledge**: Understand what a "large" effect means in your specific field.

- **Sample Size**: Smaller samples can lead to more variability in effect size estimates.

- **Study Design**: Consider the design and methodology of the study.

---

## Reporting Effect Sizes
When reporting effect sizes, it's important to include:

- **Magnitude**: The calculated effect size value.

- **Confidence Interval**: Provides a range in which the true effect size likely falls.

- **Contextual Interpretation**: Explain the practical significance of the effect size in the context of your study.

---

## Benefits of Effect Size Thinking

- **Enhanced Understanding**: Provides a clearer understanding of the impact of findings.

- **Improved Decision Making**: Helps in making informed decisions based on the magnitude of effects.

- **Facilitates Meta-Analysis**: Easier to synthesize and compare results across multiple studies.

---

## Conclusion
Effect size thinking is crucial for understanding and communicating the importance of scientific findings. 

It goes beyond statistical significance and offers a deeper insight into the practical implications of research results.
