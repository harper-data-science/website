## HARUG "Hello world" using Quarto

**New HARUG! webpage using Quarto and Github Pages.**

Quarto is a new(ish) markdown-style language that has a very simple workflow and can be use to make sophisticated webpages, slides, and reports.

While it is probably easier and more modern than plain markdown or R Markdown, a big advantage is that it can be used to make documents with live code for a variety of languages, including both R and Python.

[REALLY excellent documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

[Good blog post about setting a quarto website up](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)



## You can render and use both R and python in Quarto

```{python}
# Python in Quarto
print('hello world')
```

```{r}
# R in Quarto
print("hello world")
```
